# üì¶ Delivery Logistics Data Analysis: Uncovering Delay Factors

![Delivery Overview](https://placehold.co/1200x300/a3ccf1/000000?text=Delhivery+Logistics+Data+Analysis)

An in-depth data analysis project to understand the key drivers behind delivery delays in Delhivery's vast logistics network, revealing actionable insights from operational data.

## Why This Matters ü§î

Timely deliveries are the backbone of logistics, and understanding what causes delays is paramount for operational efficiency and customer satisfaction. Delhivery's extensive network faces complex challenges. This project leverages data analysis to:

* Identify the most impactful factors influencing delivery outcomes.
* Visualize key patterns in operational data, from geographical distributions to time-based trends.
* Provide foundational insights for strategic decision-making and optimization initiatives.

Our analysis offers a clear, data-driven perspective on the factors contributing to "On-Time" vs. "Delayed" shipments, providing a robust base for future predictive modeling or operational improvements.

## Project Goals üéØ

The primary goals of this data analysis project were:

* To conduct an extensive exploratory data analysis (EDA) on Delhivery logistics trip data.
* To identify and visualize the most significant features influencing delivery delays.
* To understand the distribution of trip types, geographical origins/destinations, and delay statuses.
* To provide clear, actionable insights that can inform operational improvements and predictive modeling efforts.

| ‚úÖ **Delay Classification** | Understanding the prevalence of On-Time vs. Delayed segments.                                            |
| ‚úÖ **Geographical Impact** | Analyzing trip distributions by source/destination states/hubs.                                          |
| ‚úÖ **Feature Relationships**| Exploring correlations between various operational metrics and their impact on delays.                  |
| ‚úÖ **Operational Factors** | Investigating the influence of factors like `Segment Factor`, `Route Type`, `Distance`, and `Time`.     |

## Analytical Approach üß™

The analysis involved:

* **Data Loading & Cleaning:** Processing raw logistics data to handle missing values and inconsistencies.
* **Feature Engineering:** Creating new features (e.g., `is_weekend`, `distance_per_hour`) to capture more granular insights.
* **Descriptive Statistics:** Summarizing key numerical and categorical variables.
* **Visualizations:** Employing various plots (bar charts, scatter plots, heatmaps, line plots) to uncover patterns and relationships.
* **Correlation Analysis:** Quantifying relationships between features.
* **Insight Generation:** Deriving actionable conclusions from the visualized data.

## Insights Snapshot üìä

Our analysis revealed several critical findings:

| Metric                          | Key Insight                                                                                              |
| :------------------------------ | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Delay Prevalence** | Delays are significantly more frequent than On-Time deliveries, indicating a major operational challenge.  |
| **Distance-Delay Relationship** | Delays are highly variable and not linearly correlated with distance; significant delays occur even on shorter routes. |
| **Top Locations** | Key operational hubs like Gurgaon and Bangalore dominate traffic, requiring focused resource management.   |
| **Operational Factors** | `Segment Factor`, `Actual Distance`, and `Route Type` are consistently identified as highly influential.   |
| **Time-of-Day Dynamics** | `Segment Factor` varies significantly by hour, pointing to specific periods of operational complexity.     |

## Visual Insights üìà

Below are some of the key visualizations generated during the data exploration phase, providing a deeper understanding of the Delhivery logistics dataset.

**Insights:**
* **Top States:** Karnataka, Maharashtra, and Haryana are key destinations for Carting trips.
* **Concentration:** Operations are concentrated in a few states, indicating specific regional demand patterns.

### 2. Segment Distance vs Delay

This scatter plot explores the relationship between the Segment Distance (OSRM Distance) and the Segment Delay.

**Insights:**
* **Variable Delays:** Delays show high variability, not a strict increase with distance.
* **Short Distance Delays:** Many significant delays occur even on shorter routes, suggesting local factors contribute heavily.

This horizontal bar chart displays the top 10 most frequent source locations (hubs/cities) from which logistics segments originate.

![Correlation Matrix with Segment Actual Time](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Onabanjomicheal/Delivery-Logistics-Data-Analysis/main/Picture4.png)

**Insights:**
* **Major Hubs:** Gurgaon-Bilaspur (Haryana) and Bangalore-Nelamangla (Karnataka) are the busiest source locations.
* **Centralized Operations:** A large volume of trips originates from a limited number of hubs, implying a centralized or hub-and-spoke model for dispatch.

### 5. Average Segment Factor by Hour of Trip Creation

This line plot illustrates how the average `Segment Factor` changes throughout the day based on the hour a trip was created.

![Segment Distance vs Delay](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Onabanjomicheal/Delivery-Logistics-Data-Analysis/main/Picture3.png)

**Insights:**
* **Diurnal Pattern:** The `Segment Factor` exhibits a clear daily pattern, with notable peaks and troughs throughout the 24-hour cycle.
* **Peak Complexity Hours:** Higher average `Segment Factor` values are observed around 4-5 AM and again around 10-11 AM, suggesting these hours might correspond to periods of increased operational complexity or challenging segment characteristics.
* **Operational Planning:** Understanding these hourly variations in segment complexity can help optimize scheduling, resource allocation, and route assignments to minimize potential issues during peak complexity periods.
